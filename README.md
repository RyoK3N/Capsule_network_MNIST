## 📚 Introduction

Capsule Networks, introduced by Geoffrey Hinton and his team, aim to overcome some limitations of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by capturing spatial hierarchies and relationships between different features in data. This application allows users to:

- **Train** a Capsule Network with customizable parameters.
- **Test** the performance of trained models.
- **Perform Inference** to make predictions on new images.

Embark on a learning journey to explore the capabilities and intricacies of Capsule Networks! 🧠✨
